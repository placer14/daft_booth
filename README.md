==========

The Daft Booth is an interactive soundboard which incorporates the samplings of the french, electronic duo Daft Punk. A project of electronics, software and mechanical design meshed together into a spectacle that anyone can use to turn themselves into a DJ of their very own. The project features the background track and sound samples from their song “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger”.
